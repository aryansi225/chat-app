# Chat Application
Chat Application in NodeJS

This a chat application built in NodeJS - Express Framework. In this application multiple people can group chat and the chat is stored in a mongodb. The data is stored, retrieved and formatted using mongoose dependency. There are a few API calls that happen from the script in frontend to fetch messages and to post messages. There is functionality also to censor bad words so that they are not saved to the db as well as not sent to other recepients. Few test cases are written in Jasmine to test the above funtionality.
